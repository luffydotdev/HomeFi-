# 🏡 HomeFi – Tokenized Real Estate Micro-Investing

**HomeFi** is a decentralized platform that enables fractional ownership and investment in global real estate through blockchain technology. By tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), HomeFi allows users to invest in high-quality rental properties with minimal capital, earning proportional income in stablecoins.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **📦 Fractional Ownership:** Invest in real estate from anywhere using tokenized shares (ERC-20 or NFTs).
- **💸 Rental Income:** Earn regular yield in stablecoins (USDC, DAI) based on your token holdings.
- **🔒 Secure & Transparent:** On-chain records for ownership, rent distribution, and asset valuation.
- **🗳️ DAO Governance:** Token holders can vote on key decisions like renovations, refinancing, or sales.
- **⚖️ Compliance-Ready:** Designed to meet security regulations in supported jurisdictions.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Property Onboarding:** Real estate providers list properties after KYC and legal review.
2. **Tokenization:** Each property is fractionalized into tokens (e.g., 100,000 tokens/property).
3. **Investment:** Users purchase tokens using stablecoins (e.g., USDC).
4. **Rental Yield:** Monthly rental income is distributed to token holders proportionally.
5. **Secondary Market:** Users can trade tokens on integrated decentralized exchanges (DEXes).
6. **DAO Participation:** Token holders can propose and vote on property management decisions.
